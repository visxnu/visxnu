name: Generate Snake
on:

  schedule:

      # every 6 hours

    - cron: "0 */6 * * *"



  
  
  This command allows us to run the Action automatically from the Actions tab.


workflow_dispatch:



  
  
  The sequence of runs in this workflow:


jobs:

  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"

  build:

    # The type of runner that the job will run on

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest



# Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
steps:

# Checks repo under $GITHUB_WORKSHOP, so your job can access it
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2

# Generates the snake  
  - uses: Platane/snk@master
    id: snake-gif
    with:
      github_user_name: visxnu
      # these next 2 lines generate the files on a branch called "output". This keeps the main branch from cluttering up.
      gif_out_path: dist/github-contribution-grid-snake.gif
      svg_out_path: dist/github-contribution-grid-snake.svg

 # show the status of the build. Makes it easier for debugging (if there's any issues).
  - run: git status

  # Push the changes
  - name: Push changes
    uses: ad-m/github-push-action@master
    with:
      github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      branch: master
      force: true

  - uses: crazy-max/ghaction-github-pages@v2.1.3
    with:
      # the output branch we mentioned above
      target_branch: output
      build_dir: dist
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}






Step 3. Running GitHub Actions
Once you've added the code above and committed it, head to your Actions tab. Under "Workflows", you should see the "Generate Snake" Action you created above.

Workflow

Click "Run Workflow" and watch your workflow run. You can even expand your workflow and see what's happening in real time.

Running Actions

Once your workflow has finished running, you should have received a green ‚úÖ "build" checkmark. If so, this means your Action is working nicely. If not, you'll have to go through the code and see where the errors are. The "build" status should give you some indication of where your errors lie. You can also compare it with the yaml file on my GitHub Profile README.

Build green

If you have the green "build" ‚úÖ then you should be good to go. Head back to your repo's "Code" directory, and change your branch to "output". Here you'll find the two versions of your contribution graph with the snake eating it: a *.gif and a *.svg. The good thing about these files is the file is rewritten over itself every time the Action runs. Thus, your contribution graph will always be up to date.

CodeOutput

Step 4. Adding a contribution-eating snake to your profile
Now the final set is to add this to your profile. Grab the file location of your *.gif. It should be something like:

https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_USERNAME/blob/output/github-contribution-grid-snake.gif

Add this to your profile by copying the file location onto a new line in your markdown file:

![snake gif](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_USERNAME/blob/output/github-contribution-grid-snake.gif)

Now you should have a really cool looking snake eating your contributions!

SnakeEating

Hopefully this guide was helpful for you and gives you a good base to start building and adding more Actions on your profile. What have you been adding to your GitHub Profile README? Other there other cool Actions I should be looking at?

Hi, First of all thanks for the precise tutorial!

There were a few changes in the action (mostly to adapt to github api), I had to change some parameters and bump the version.

Unfortunately a lot of people use the edge version ( with the tag #master ). It's a bit of a mess but the result is that this version is deprecated and can no longer work without adding some modification from the user (adding a github token as param)

The recommended usage is now this declaration:

- uses: Platane/snk/svg-only@v3
  with:
    github_user_name: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
    outputs: |
      dist/github-snake.svg
Check the readme for details about the new options

I didn't change the background colour. It's a .png/.svg image, meaning the background is transparent. It looks dark on mine because I have dark mode enabled on GitHub. You can enable it by clicking Settings --> Appearance --> choosing your mode.

Hello everyone, before proceeding, please navigate to 'Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow Permissions' in your README.md file and select 'Read and Write' permissions. This is important because if you have other permissions selected, it may result in errors.

Getting this error when I try to run workflow and after it fails:
Node.js 12 actions are deprecated. Please update the following actions to use Node.js 16: actions/checkout@v2. For more information see: https://github.blog/changelog/2022-09-22-github-actions-all-actions-will-begin-running-on-node16-instead-of-node12/.

If the action fails, you can go to repo settings, click action, then select general, and look at the bottom where it says read and write.
